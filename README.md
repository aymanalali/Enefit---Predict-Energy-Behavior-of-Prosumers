In the Enefit Energy Behavior Project we did the following:

1-Created a pipeline for time series prediction.

2-Performed extensive feature engineering and trained two LightGBM models.

3-Integrated datasets with varying temporal resolutions for precise forecasting.
 
The code in the provided notebook uses the following libraries:

1-Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

2-NumPy: For numerical operations and array handling.

3-Scikit-learn: For machine learning model training and evaluation.

4-LightGBM: For gradient boosting machine learning models.

5-Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
